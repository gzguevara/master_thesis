## My Master Thesis

If there would be one easy accessible source of information, which relefects all human activity over time and for different activity types - wouldn't this be amazing!? This is probably the wet dream of every data scientist? right? :) Well, turns out there is something very similar! It is called web-search traffic. The google search engine accounts for around 80% of all internet activity. At the same time google provides a web-search anlysis tool, which is called Google Trends. Google Trends provides aggregated web-search traffic data for different time periods based on different search topics - and the access is free! <br />
<br />
In my master thesis I used web-search traffic by Google Trends to analyse investment activity in startups. The world of startups is is notorios for lacking data. Young companies usullay cannot provid long-term records to prove stability nor long-term success of their business. Investors usually rely on subjective factors in the investment process. This thesis shows that internet traffic is a valid source of alternative data for evaluating startups subject to venture capital investments.
